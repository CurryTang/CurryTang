### Hi there 👋

I'm currently a CS PhD student at Michigan State University.

## Research & Projects

### 1. DL Infra, Agent, Long Context Modeling (2026-present)
Currently working on new directions.

**Projects**
* [Slack GPU Monitor](https://github.com/CurryTang/slack-gpu-monitor): A slack bot to manage your server's GPU.

**Writings**
* [A tutorial on DL Infra (Chinese version)](https://publish.obsidian.md/zhikaichen/notes/Mlsys/MLSYS1)
* [Notes on optimization](https://publish.obsidian.md/zhikaichen/notes/Optimization/Convergence+rate)

### 2. Relational Deep Learning (2025-present)

* [AutoG: Towards automatic graph construction from tabular data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02054) **Zhikai Chen**, Han Xie, Jian Zhang, Xiang Song, Jiliang Tang, Huzefa Rangwala, George Karypis; ICLR 2025 (poster) [Code](https://github.com/amazon-science/Automatic-Table-to-Graph-Generation)
* [A Pre-training Framework for Relational Data with Information-theoretic Principles](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.09837) Quang Truong, **Zhikai Chen**, Mingxuan Ju, Tong Zhao, Neil Shah, Jiliang Tang, NeurIPS 2025
* A RDL understanding paper with both empirical and theoretical explorations (stealth mode)
* Relational foundation model (a library and a pre-trained model, stealth mode)

### 3. Graph Foundation Models and Large Language Models (2023-2025)

> **Note:** In the past, I worked on graph foundation models (especially on text-attributed graphs) for a while, these related libraries won't be maintained any more. I personally don't recommend newcomers working on these settings and datasets.

* [Graph Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02216) Haitao Mao\*, **Zhikai Chen\***, Wenzhuo Tang, Jianan Zhao, Yao Ma, Tong Zhao, Neil Shah, Michael Galkin, Jiliang Tang 2024 [[Paper lists](https://github.com/CurryTang/Towards-Graph-Foundation-Models-New-perspective-)]; ICML 2024 (Spotlight); * means equal contribution
* [Text-space Graph Foundation Models: Comprehensive Benchmarks and New Insights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10727) **Zhikai Chen**, Haitao Mao, Jingzhe Liu, Yu Song, Bingheng Li, Wei Jin, Bahare Fatemi, Anton Tsitsulin, Bryan Perozzi, Hui Liu, Jiliang Tang [Code](https://github.com/CurryTang/TSGFM); NeurIPS 2024 Datasets and Benchmarks Track (poster)
* Exploring the Potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Learning on Graphs
[preprint version](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03393v3) [journal version](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03393), **Zhikai Chen**, Haitao Mao, Hang Li, Wei Jin, Hongzhi Wen, Xiaochi Wei, Shuaiqiang Wang, Dawei Yin, Wenqi Fan, Hui Liu, Jiliang Tang 2023 [Code](https://github.com/CurryTang/Graph-LLM); SIGKDD Explorations and NeurIPS GLFrontiers 2023
* [Label-free Node Classification on Graphs with Large Language Models (LLMS)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04668), **Zhikai Chen**, Haitao Mao, Hongzhi Wen, Haoyu Han, Wei Jin, Haiyang Zhang, Hui Liu, Jiliang Tang [Code](https://github.com/CurryTang/LLMGNN); ICLR 2024(poster)
* [Neural Scaling Laws on Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02054) Jingzhe Liu, Haitao Mao, **Zhikai Chen**, Tong Zhao, Neil Shah, Jiliang Tang; LOG 2024
