I'm currently a CS PhD student from Michigan State University. My research interest lies in graph machine learning (past & current & future), symmetry-inspired machine learning (current & future), and probabilistic machine learning (future). A summarization of my past works:

***Synergizing large language models and graph machine learning***

(: Personally, I don't like these lines of work much, but they earn me lots of citations

* Exploring the Potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Learning on Graphs
